Welcome to Sweeter Tweet Reader!

This utility is intended for a situation where you have a single twitter account, and you want 
authenticated access to twitter to pull in tweets for that account. 

Sweeter Tweet Reader is designed for a single-user use case. You will need to setup an application 
and access tokens with twitter. For more information and to setup your application please visit:

http://dev.twitter.com/pages/oauth_single_token

Sweeter Tweet Reader models can be written to accommodate various needs, and views can present data 
in whatever way you might desire. 

The default model and view provide the home timeline for the account.

Twitter goes down a little bit too often ... for that reason, we use caching to show what we last
grabbed, and do the updates in the background. Basically, each page hit, we show our cached tweets, 
and try to refresh the tweets in the background if possible.

On sites with a reasonable amount of traffic this approach works quite well and your site should 
never sit waiting for twitter to respond. It also puts the tweets right in your HTML instead of 
relying on javascript to inject content, which makes your site faster and more accessible.

USAGE:

1. Put the SweeterTweetReader folder outside of the web tree.

2. Make an alias inside your web tree to the SweeterTweetReader www folder.

3. Make a copy of config_default.php and call it config.php.

4. Configure config.php to setup paths and oauth credentials.

In a browser go to the SweeterTweetReader www folder using the alias you setup in #2.
